Introduction:
----------------------
Pychube is a Python client for pachube.com.

Pychube passes sensor readings, which are passed as arguments, to a 
Pachube feed. The main advantage pychube has over a simple curl request, 
is that pachube user details are stored in a .config file in the users 
home directory. This ensures that API key is never disclosed via top or ps.

Pychube was tested using Python 2.7.1 and Linux.

It may work unaltered on Mac OSX, but I have not tested it.

Windows is not supported at the moment.

----------------------
Setup:
----------------------
Place the following three lines into ~/.pychube, and personalise as 
required:

[pachube]
apiKey=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
feedID=1234


If you would like to install pychube, copy the file to /usr/bin:
cp pychube /usr/bin/pychube

Alternatively, you may run it from its current location by prefixing 
with ./:
./pychube

----------------------
Usage:
----------------------
Pass the sensor readings to pachube as a commandline parameter.
For example, to update a single datastream feed with a value of 48:
user@host:~# pychube 48

Multiple datastream  feeds can be updated by comma separating the values:
user@host:~# pychube 48,-5,100

Datavalues can also be piped to pychube. This can be used in conjunction 
with awk, sed or grep to manipulate the input:
user@host:~# uptime | awk -F'( |,)' '{print $2}' | awk -F ":" '{print 
$1}' | pychube

TODO:
----------------------
Add Windows support.
